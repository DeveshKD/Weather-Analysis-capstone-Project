# Weather Data Analysis Project üå¶Ô∏è

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes weather patterns for multiple cities worldwide, using structured and normalized datasets. The focus includes understanding temperature trends, humidity levels, wind patterns, and their relationships with weather-related events. The project also incorporates techniques to handle wide data formats, transform them into usable forms, and extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze weather trends across different cities, including temperature, humidity, and wind patterns.
- Identify and assess extreme weather conditions like storms, hurricanes, and their potential impact.
- Evaluate anomalies in weather data to understand unusual patterns.
- Visualize and communicate findings through graphs and dashboards.

## Significance
Weather data plays a crucial role in decision-making for environmental planning, disaster management, and sustainable urban development. By uncovering trends and anomalies, this project contributes to understanding the dynamic nature of climatic conditions and their implications for society.
